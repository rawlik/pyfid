Simulation module
=================

FIDsim class
------------

The most important is the FIDsim class.
It can simulate an FID signal of given parametres.
The constructor requires explicit functions for the amplitude evolution
(`amplitude_model`), phase evolution (`phase_model`).
Once the object is created it has a fixed amplitude and
phase evolutions.

Samples of an FID signal can be generated by calling `simulate()`.
Each call will add new random white noise on top of the signal.
If an explicit function to filter the signal is be passed
(`filter_func`) the function is applied to the signal after the noise
has been added.

.. autoclass:: pyfid.simulation.FIDsim     
   :members: 

   .. automethod:: __init__


Constructor functions
---------------------
There is a range of construction functons for particular models of FIDs.

.. automodule:: pyfid.simulation
   :exclude-members: FIDsim
   :members:
   :undoc-members:


Example
-------
Create an FID simulation object.
The frequency change model used is "rand_poly_frequency" and the `deg`
parameter is set to `1`. So at the time of the construction of the object
a random first-degree (linear) function of the frequency vs time will be
generated. The `drift` parameter describes how large the drift is.
